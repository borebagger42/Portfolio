This is a virtual reality game designed for the Meta Quest 2, also compatible with the Meta Quest 3. Other compatibilities have not been tested. I make use of hand tracking to provide the player with an experience of summoning fire as if they were a firebender. I apologize for the lack of a demo as I do not have individual access to the technology required. 

Here are the links to download the apk and full unity project files, should you be interested:
